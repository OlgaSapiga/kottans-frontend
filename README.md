Now I feel confident using Git and GitHub. The course [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) was really interesting, subtitles help me to understand better. In the [resources to learn Git](http://try.github.io/) the best task(or training) was [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/courses).
## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Course about command line was interesting and not so hard to understand.
Information about HTTP was new to me, but it was difficult to understand and realize things about HTTP.
Although, information about secure HTTP surprised me, I didn't know this protocol.
In future I want to use secure connection on the web, also SSL and TLS to encrypt and decrypt data between HTTP and TCP.
