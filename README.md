Task 0:
Now I feel confident using Git and GitHub. The course [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) was really interesting, subtitles help me to understand better. In the [resources to learn Git](http://try.github.io/) the best task(or training) was [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/courses).
## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I really like this task. It was pretty similar to task 0, but more understandable for me.
