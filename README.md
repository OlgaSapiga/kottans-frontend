Task 0:
Now I feel confident using Git and GitHub. The course [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) was really interesting, subtitles help me to understand better. In the [resources to learn Git](http://try.github.io/) the best task(or training) was [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/courses).
## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Course about command line was interesting and not so hard to understand.
Information about HTTP was new to me, but it was difficult to understand and realize things about HTTP.
Although, information about secure HTTP surprised me, I didn't know this protocol.
In future I want to use secure connection on the web, also SSL and TLS to encrypt and decrypt data between HTTP and TCP.
## Git Collaboration

I really like this task. It was pretty similar to task 0, but more understandable for me.
## Intro to HTML and CSS

<br>
This task was interesting. I have already done course in HTML Academy, so course in Udacity was like remembering and repeating basics of HTML and CSS.
## Responsive Web Design

Course about responsive web design was fascinating and educational. I completed it without a pause. Course about flexbox was really simple and funny with these frogs.

The subtask 1 was very interesting and understanding, instead of subtask 2, which was difficult. I tried to complete challenges on my own, but always used hints. I want to improve my skills using extra materials.
